// 10.Exercise: Optional Chaining

// Create an interface User.
// User has address that may not be defined, and address has street, and zipCode.
// Create an object user1 with nested property: address.
// Use optional chaining to access the zipCode property to print with console.log.


interface User {
  address?: {
    street: string;
    zipCode: string | number;
  };
}

const user1: User = {
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    zipCode: "V5B 1A1"
  }
};

console.log(user1.address?.zipCode);


const userWithoutAddress: User = {};
console.log(userWithoutAddress.address?.zipCode);
